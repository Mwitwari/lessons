"LOOPS"
"i) FOR loops"
"ii) WHILE loops"

# numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# for number in numbers:
#     new_number= number + 2

#     print(new_number)



"loop through a list of floats and get modulus of 2"

# numbers=[ 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6]
# for number in numbers:
#     new_number= number%2
#     print(new_number)


# numbers= [20, 50, 60, 89, 456]
# for number in numbers:
#     value= number/2
#     print(value)


"Nested loops- Always completes the innermost one"

# months= ["jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may"]
# days= ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thur", "fri"]
# # weeks= [1, 2, 3, 4]

# for month in months:
#     for day in days:
#         # for week in weeks:
#      print(month, day)



"Statements within loops"
"i)Continue- skips desired value"

# for letter in "Python":
#     if letter=="h":
#         continue
#     print(letter)

"ii)pass- recognizes sth should happen or acts as a placeholder"

# numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# for number in numbers:
#     if number==3:
#         pass
#         # print(number)
#     print(number)

"break- ends a list..."
# numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# for number in numbers:
#     if number==3:
#         break
#     print(number)



"ii)While loop"

# number= 0
# while number<5:
#     print(number)
#     number +=1



# age=0
# while True:
#     age+=1
#     if age==3:
#         break
#     print(age)



"FUNCTIONS"
"Sum"

# def add_numbers(num1, num2):
#     num3=num1+num2 
#     print(num3)
#     return
# add_numbers(1, 2)


"difference"
# def subtracting(a, b):
#     # c=b - a
#     print(b - a)
#     return
# subtracting(6, 2)

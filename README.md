# Python Learning Progress

This repository documents my weekly progress as I learn Python, covering core concepts, data structures, web scraping, OOP, and more.


##  Week One

We studied the basic rules and syntax of Python, including:

- Printing to the console
- Commenting
- Variables
- Operators
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions


##  Week Two

We explored fundamental data structures and pattern matching:

- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Regular Expressions (RegEx)


## Week Three

We dove into interacting with the web:

- Web Scraping (using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`)
- Handling APIs (making requests and parsing JSON data)


##  Week Four

We covered advanced programming concepts and integration:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Working with Packages
- Introduction to Databases (CRUD operations, SQL basics)


Stay tuned for more updates as we continue the journey! ðŸš€
